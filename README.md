# Pixel-boot-animation-magisk
This simple Magisk module applies boot animations of Pixel phones. New Google Pixel (from 9 series on) Gemini boot animation and legacy will both be available here.

The Google logo can only be used if you have an existing partnership or sponsorship and youâ€™ve reached out to your Google contact to secure formal approval from the Google brand team. Please consult [Google Brand Resource Center](https://about.google/brand-resource-center/).

*Legacy boot animation is available now in releases*

**ONLY VERIFIED ON LINEAGE OS 22.1 WITH APATCH**

## Mechanism

The Android system sources `/system/product/media/bootanimation.zip` and `/system/product/media/bootanimation-dark.zip` for boot animation (not to be mistaken with manufacturers' boot splash Logo).

This module replaces files mentioned above to deliver Pixel phones' boot animation to AOSP-based custom ROMs, not all of them sources these locations and works though...

## Known issues

### Screen ratio may be wierd

Boot animation files are extracted from Google Pixel 9 (for the Gemini boot animation) and Google Pixel 8 (for the legacy boot animation, the Monet Engine coloured "G" Logo), so it might have wierd screen ratio on "certain" devices, such as Sony Xperia with its 21:9 screen.
